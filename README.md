## Description
Planning out the hierarchaical class structure of a Zoo.  
The Zoo contains an Animal class as the base and is broken down as follow:
- Mammal -> Feline -> Lion, Cougar, Tiger
- Mammal -> Canine -> Fox, Wolf
- Bird -> Ostrich, Penguine, Eagle
- Fish -> Clown, Puffer
------------------------------
## Application of OOP Principles

### Interfaces

### Inheritance
Classes have the ability to reuse properties and methods of other classes overriding their behivior.

### Abstraction
Showing only the required attributes of a calss and hiding the rest.

### Polymorphism
The ability of objects of differing types to implement the same methods

### Encapsulation
Encapsulation allows properties and methods to be consider a single entity or object.
